title: Microplastics in the Great Lakes

## Intro ##
welcome: Welcome
welcome-p1: >-
  Microplastics are a growing contaminant of concern in freshwater environments, 
  yet sources, transport, and fate remain unclear. 
  
welcome-p2: >-
  Microplastics are smaller than 5 millimeters in size. 
  They come from a wide range of sources such as synthetic clothing, cigarette butts, 
  disposable diapers, cosmetic product microbeads, plastic bags, wrappers, and degraded pieces of plastic litter. 
  
welcome-p3: >- 
  In 2014–15, the U.S. Geological Survey and the State University of New York at Fredonia 
  sampled the quantity and particle types of floating microplastics in 29 rivers flowing into 
  the Great Lakes in 6 states as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. 

## Relative Abundance ##
relAbundance-intro1: >-
  In 2015, the United States Congress passed <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1321' target='_blank'>Public Law 114-114</a> to ban the sale of products containing microbeads.
  The ban for sale of these products starts in 2018. 
  However, microbeads are only a small fraction of microplastics found in the environment. 

relAbundance-title: Relative Abundance
relAbundance-p1: >-
  Microplastics were found in all tributary samples analyzed. Fibers were the dominant 
  particle type, making up an average of 71 percent of each sample.

## Environmental Effects ##
envEffects-title: How have microplastics been observed in the environment?
envEffects-p1: >-
  Marine organisms including mammals, birds, fish, turtles, and invertebrates 
  have been shown to ingest microplastics. Physical hazards of ingestion can include 
  obstruction of the digestive system, clogging of feeding appendages, oxidative stress, 
  impaired reproduction, and death.

envEffects-p2: >-
  In addition, ingestion of microplastics may result in uptake and bioaccumulation of 
  harmful chemicals. Additives in plastic such as phthalates, brominated flame retardants, 
  nonylphenol, and antimicrobials have been associated with cancer and endocrine disruption. 
  The high sorption capacity of plastic enables the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants 
  such as polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organochlorine pesticides, 
  with concentrations of 105 – 106 times higher than in the surrounding water column. Trace metals 
  and pathogens have also been shown to accumulate on microplastics.

## Land Use Correlation ##
landUse-intro: How do microplastics get into our rivers and streams?
landUse-title: Land use surronding rivers correlate to some types of microplastics, but not the dominating fiber contributor.
landUse-p1: >-
  Fibers were present in watersheds with all types of land use and varying wastewater effluent contributions

landUse-p2: >-
  Fragments, films, and foams were more frequent in samples from more urban basins
