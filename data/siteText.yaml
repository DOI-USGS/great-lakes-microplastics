title: Microplastics in the Great Lakes

## Intro ##
welcome: Welcome
welcome-p1: >-
  Microplastics are a contaminant of emerging concern in aquatic environments. 
welcome-p2: >-
  Microplastics are smaller than 5 millimeters in size.
  They come from a wide range of sources such as synthetic clothing, cigarette butts, disposable diapers, cosmetic product microbeads, plastic bags, wrappers, and degraded pieces of plastic litter. 
	
## Relative Abundance ##
relAbundance-intro1: >-	
  In 2015, the United States Congress passed <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1321' target='_blank'>Public Law 114-114</a> to ban the sale of products containing microbeads.	
  The ban for sale of these products starts in 2018. 
  However, microbeads are only a small fraction of microplastics found in the environment.
