title: Microplastics in the Great Lakes

## Intro ##
welcome: Welcome
welcome-p1: >-
  Microplastics are a growing contaminant of concern in freshwater environments, yet sources, transport, and fate remain unclear. 
  
welcome-p2: >-
  Microplastics are smaller than 5 millimeters in size. 
  They come from a wide range of sources such as synthetic clothing, cigarette butts, 
  disposable diapers, cosmetic product microbeads, plastic bags, wrappers, and degraded pieces of plastic litter. 
  
welcome-p3: >- 
  In 2014â€“15, the U.S. Geological Survey and the State University of New York at Fredonia 
  sampled the quantity and particle types of floating microplastics in 29 rivers flowing into 
  the Great Lakes in 6 states as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. 

## Relative Abundance ##
relAbundance-intro1: >-
  In 2015, the United States Congress passed <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1321' target='_blank'>Public Law 114-114</a> to ban the sale of products containing microbeads.
  The ban for sale of these products starts in 2018. 
  However, microbeads are only a small fraction of microplastics found in the environment.

relAbundance-p1: >-
  Microplastics were found in all tributary samples analyzed. Fibers were the dominant 
  particle type, making up an average of 71 percent of each sample.

## Land Use Correlation ##
landUse-intro: How do microplastics get into our rivers and streams?
landUse-title: Figure 3 Title
landUse-p1: >-
  Fibers were present in watersheds with all types of land use and varying wastewater effluent contributions

landUse-p2: >-
  Fragments, films, and foams were more frequent in samples from more urban basins
