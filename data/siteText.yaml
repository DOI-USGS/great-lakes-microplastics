title: Microplastics in our waterways

## Intro ##
welcome: Microplastics in our waterways
welcome-subnote1: >-
  Microbeads have been banned, but the fight against microplastics pollution is only just beginning.
welcome-subnote2: Brought to you by USGS-VIZLAB
welcome-p1: >-
  Tiny plastic fragments fall off of our decomposing bottles and bags and are 
  intentionally manufactured into some toothpastes and lotions. Scientists have found
  microplastics nearly everywhere and especially in lakes, rivers, and aquatic animals.

## Environmental Effects ##

## Environmental Hazards ##
envHazards-title: What are the known risks of microplastic pollution?
envHazards-p1: >-
  Microplastics can harm humans, wildlife, and fish through:
envHazards-p2: >-
  The physical hazards of ingesting plastic particles 
  (fish, birds, and other animals can experience digestive obstruction, oxidative stress, 
  impaired reproduction, and death)
envHazards-p3: >-
  Unhealthy additives in the plastic 
  (phthalates, brominated flame retardants, nonylphenol, and antimicrobials are 
  sometimes added to plastic and have been associated with cancer and endocrine disruption)
envHazards-p4: >-
  Pollutants that accumulate on the plastic particles 
  (polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides, 
  trace metals, and even pathogens have been found at high concentrations on microplastics)

## Microbead Ban ##
beadBan-title: Can we kick the microplastics habit? 
beadBan-p1: >-
  Weâ€™re trying. In 2015, the United States Congress passed 
  <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1321' target='_blank'>Public Law 114-114</a> 
  to ban the sale of cosmetics containing microbeads. The ban takes effect in 2018.
beadBan-p2: >-
  The ban addresses microbeads alone, in part because early studies indicated that 
  microbeads are the most common type of microplastic in aquatic ecosystems.
  However, those early studies all took place in lakes. Is the same true in rivers?

## Relative Abundance ##
relAbundance-intro1: >-
  USGS scientists sampled rivers flowing into the Great Lakes<sup><a href='#ref3'>3</a></sup> 
  to find out which kinds of microplastics are most common in rivers, 
  and which rivers are the most polluted with microplastics.

relAbundance-p1: >-
  They found that rivers carry many kinds of microplastics, of which microbeads are a surprisingly small fraction.
relAbundance-p2: >-
  Instead, fibers averaged 71% of the total number of microplastics particles in these river water samples.

relAbundance-foams-label: Foams

## Land Use Correlation ##
landUse-title: How are plastics getting into our rivers?

landUse-p1: >-
  That turns out to be a tricky question, and at first there seemed to be few patterns.

landUse-p2: >-
  Though the relationship is modest, it seems that urban watersheds tend to produce the most plastic-rich rivers. 
  This is especially true for fragments, films, and foams.

## Conclusion ##
conclusion-title: What's next?
conclusion-p1: >-
 While the ban on microbeads has raised public awareness, the microplastics story is large and complex. 
 Studies like this one are bringing us toward a better understanding of the many forms and fates of microplastics.
