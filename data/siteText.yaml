## Intro ##
welcome: Microplastics in our Nation's Waterways
welcome-subnote1: >-
  Microbeads have been banned, but the fight against microplastics pollution is only just beginning.

  Microplastics are the miniscule plastic fragments (smaller than 0.04 inch) that fall off of decomposing plastic bottles and bags, and are 
  intentionally manufactured into some toothpastes and lotions. Scientists have found
  microplastics nearly everywhere, particularly in lakes, rivers, and aquatic animals.

## Environmental Effects ##

## Environmental Hazards ##
envHazards-title: What are the known risks of microplastic pollution?
envHazards-p1: >-
  Microplastics can be harmful to humans, as well as wildlife through:
envHazards-p2: >-
  The physical hazards of ingesting plastic particles 
  (fish, birds, and other animals can experience digestive obstruction, impaired reproduction, other adverse biological effects, and even death)
envHazards-p3: >-
  The unhealthy additives found in plastic particles 
  (some additives have been associated with cancer and endocrine disruption)
envHazards-p4: >-
  The contaminants that accumulate on plastic particles 
  (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's), organochlorine pesticides, trace metals, and even pathogens have been found at high concentrations on microplastics)

## Microbead Ban ##
beadBan-title: Can we kick the microplastics habit? 
beadBan-p1: >-
  We’re trying. In 2015, the U.S. Congress passed 
  <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1321' target='_blank'>Public Law 114-114</a> 
  to ban the sale of cosmetics containing plastic microbeads. The ban takes effect in 2018.
beadBan-p2: >-
  The ban addresses microbeads alone, in part because early studies indicated that 
  microbeads were the most common type of microplastic found in aquatic ecosystems.
  However, those early studies all took place in lakes. Is the same true in rivers?

## Relative Abundance ##
relAbundance-intro1: >-
  U.S. Geological Survey and State University of New York Fredonia scientists sampled rivers flowing into the Great Lakes<sup><a href='#ref3'>3</a></sup> 
  to find out which kinds of microplastics are most commonly found in rivers, 
  and which rivers contain the most microplastics particles.

relAbundance-p1: >-
  These scientists found that rivers carry many different kinds of microplastics, 
  and were surprised to learn that plastic microbeads make up only a small fraction of all microplastics.
relAbundance-p2: >-
  The USGS scientists found that fibers composed an average of 71% of the total number of microplastics 
  particles found in samples of river water.

## Land Use Correlation ##
landUse-title: How are plastics getting into our rivers?

landUse-p1: >-
  That turns out to be a tricky question. USGS scientists plotted the microplastics data 
  for the river water samples collected at various locations. Then they compared those data to 
  land-use types found at those same sampling locations to determine if there seemed to be any patterns in the data.


landUse-p2: >-
  Hover over the data on the graph below for more information.

landUse-p3: >-
  Though the relationship is modest, it appears that urban watersheds tend to be associated with rivers that have 
  high concentrations of microplastics in the water, which is especially true for plastic fragments, films, and foams. However, scientists were surprised to find no apparent 
  pattern between land use and the most commonly observed microplastic type - fibers.

## Conclusion ##
conclusion-title: What's next?
conclusion-p1: >-
 While the ban on plastic microbeads has raised public awareness, the microplastics story is large and complex. 
 Studies like this one conducted by USGS and SUNY Fredonia scientists and funded by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
 are bringing us toward a better understanding of the many forms and fates of microplastics in our Nation's waterways.
